        <h1 class='txt-xl mb6'>Your Water is Owned by Who?</h1>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency tracks <b>147,354 individual water systems</b> in the United States (Q2 2017). 81% of those systems are publicly run, 17% are private, and 2% are public-private partnerships.</p>
        <p>The average annual water bill for households using 60,000 gallons of water a year is <b>$329.06</b>. Privately controlled water systems charge customers an average of $500.96, a <b>59% increase</b> over the average bill for publicly run water systems, $315.56.</p>
        <p>When private corporations buy public water utilities, customers pay for it.</p>

        <div class='txt-ul'>
          <div class='txt-li'>Private water companies are more likely to <b>cherry pick service areas to avoid serving low-income communities</b> where low water use or bill collection probelms could hurt corporate profits</div>
          <div class='txt-li'>Customers who are <b>unhappy with their service have no recourse</b> if the utility is privately owned - they cannot switch to a different water utility and they cannot effect change by voting to replace water commissioners</div>
          <div class='txt-li'>Privatization typically leads to a <b>loss of one in three water jobs</b></div>
          <div class='txt-li'>After privatization, water rates increase at about three times the rate of inflation, with an <b>average increase of 18 percent every other year</b>
